# Data-Analytics-Projects

This model was created as my final project in the Iron-Hack Data Analytics Bootcamp and presented at the Hack Show, winning first place.

The model uses the 2019 ISIC dataset, which contains 20,000 images of skin lesions. 

The first model predicts whether the lesion is cancerous or benign
The second model predicts what type of cancer the lesion is
Because the dataset is not balanced, the types were divided into 3 categories.
